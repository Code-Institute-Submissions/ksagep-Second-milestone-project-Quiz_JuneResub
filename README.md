## Version control

I used two repositories during the development: GitPod for local repository and GitHub for remote or background repository. 

I managed the versions with the following process:
- I created a repository in GitHub
- I opened and developped the repository in GitPod
- I created and developped the files and folders in GitPod
- I saved and pushed my works to GitHub repository:
    1. git add . - adding work to git
    2. git commit -m "Commit message" - to commit the stage of work
    3. git push - to update my work in GitHub

## Publishing

The steps of the publishing on the GitHub were as follow:
    
    1. **"Settings"** on the repository
    2. **"Source"** of "GitHub Pages" selected *master for Branch* and saved it
    3. The website was published on GitHub Pages and the link was provided in the same section.
