## Testing

### Browser testing

Website was tested in Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Safari. On each browser this website works properly (functionality, visuality).

It was tested on  Macbook Pro, Apple iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung A6 and A10 mobile phones and the website worked on these type of devices.

### Validators

The website was checked by W3C HTML validator and it did not reported any issues.

The website was checked by W3C Jigsaw validator and it found one analysis problem:
* #basic { font-family: Oswald; font-weight: 500; color: rgb(0,0,0); background-color: beige; }

This problem did not affect the run of the website.

### Local testing

The buttons of the website were tested locally and these worked properly. Size of some images did not matched with the regulations and conditions. These unmatched issues had to be fixed and after were done.

### Responsiveness

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools for this exercise. I tested for mobile and desktop devices and it worked properly. According to the tool, some images were too big for mobile devices and the downloads were slow. 

## Version control

I used two repositories during the development: GitPod for local repository and GitHub for remote or background repository. 

I managed the versions with the followung process:
- I created a repository in GitHub
- I opened and developped the repository in GitPod
- I created and developped the files and folders in GitPod
- I saved and pushed my works to GitHub repository:
    1. git add . - adding work to git
    2. git commit -m "Commit message" - to commit the stage of work
    3. git push - to update my work in GitHub

## Publishing

The steps of the publishing on the GitHub were as follow:
    
    1. **"Settings"** on the repository
    2. **"Source"** of "GitHub Pages" selected *master for Branch* and saved it
    3. The website was published on GitHub Pages and the link was provided in the same section.
